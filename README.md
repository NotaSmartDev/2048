# 2048 clone by [s0lst1ce](https://github.com/s0lst1ce)

This is a 2048 clone. Original game concept is from Gabriele Cirulli. This clone was made with python 3.7 and pygame2.



## How to play

The goal of the game is to have a tile with the value of "2048" on the board. In oder to achieve this you need to merge tiles. Tiles with the same values will merge when moved into one another. You loose when you can no longer move. Moving is done by using the arrow keys.

NB: Currently you loose when all tiles are occupied. This is an issue which will be fixed along with the addition of the score displayer.



## Installation

### Python

As the game is written in python it can be ran directly with the python interpreter.  In order for it to work you need to install the `pygame` dependency. For this run `python -m pip install pygame` under any OS. The game was written under pygame2 but it should work with prior version if you need to.

### Windows

The game is compiled into a single windows executable with each release. Just head over to the release page and grab the binary you want to play with! However do note that you will still need to download the game assets as they are not included in the `exe`. Add the `sprites` and `audio` folders beside the executable.

### Linux

The game is compiled into a single binary with each release. Just head over to the release page and grab the binary you want to play with! However do note that you will still need to download the game assets as they are not included in the binary. Add the `sprites` and `audio` folders beside the executable.
